 *  @defgroup MSP430_System_Layer MSP430 System Layer
 *  @brief  MSP430 System Layer APIs.
 *          To interface with any platform, eMPL needs access to various
 *          system layer functions.
 *
 *  @{
 *      @file       msp430_clock.h
 *      @brief      Functions to configure the MSP430 system clock to settings
 *                  required for eMPL.
 *      @details    ACLK, MCLK, and SMCLK are all sourced directly by the DCO.
 *                  The DCO frequency is set by multiplying the internal
 *                  32.768kHz oscillator, which may vary in performance between
 *                  multiple chips. This may be an issue for time-critical
 *                  tasks such as providing a baud rate reference.

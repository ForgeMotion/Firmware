Dev notes 8.22

Audio
	Filenames are always uppercase 8.3 format
	Looks like files will can be raw, or mp3 if mp3 library is added
	Need to look at memory consumption once its running and alloc only what's needed

	Ok, we're going to use the SerialFlash library, which has an audio to DAQ example (MP3Player.ino)
	It also has a python script to send data to the teensy, and a sketch to pass the data onto the flash chip (CopyFromSerial.ino)

	Got successful erase and read/write from flash memory - for yellow PCB, had to add following to both erase and r/w examples:
		SPI.setMOSI(11);
		SPI.setMISO(12);

Tap Detection
	See Tap detection dev notes 9.8.c

Merging MPU6050 library changes:
	The MPU calibration code that someone wrote a while ago, someone figured out the bugs and posted about it. Saving a current version and then I'll build in their changes and test it. (done)

	Latest lib uses MPU6050_DMP_FIFO_RATE_DIVISOR to set dmp read frequency (f = 200Hz/(1+MPU6050_DMP_FIFO_RATE_DIVISOR)), I used MPU6050_DMP_FIFO_RATE_DIVISOR = 0x03 in last version, so that will need to be in the new main code
	Added in the proper euler equation, using an ifdef for a quick reversion
	Added in the getNorm function (unsure if it was ever used)


Full System factory calibration
	The hardware test sketch needs to be updated
	it should get calibration values for the IMU and save them to eeprom
	main code should pull them from eeprom on boot

Reducing BOM Cost
	Check viability of using M0+ (MKL26Z64VFT4)
		Pins:
			Has DAC and I2S
			Need:
				7 PWM for motors
				3 for RGB (preferrably PWM)
				2 pin for I2C
				3 for SPI
				2 for SPI CS pins

				Analog in for battery
				4 digital in (Vol_up, Vol_down, MPU_INT, AUDIO_SHDN)
				1 DAC or 3 I2S (mono or stereo - uses SHDN pin)

				=10 pwm, 2 i2c, 3 spi, 1 analog, 6 gpio, 1-3 audio
			Has:
				Analog
				10 PWM
				27 pins broken out, maybe 3 more usable on chip
				27 - 3(spi) - 2*(i2c) - 10(pwm) = 10 pins
				totally fine!
		Code size:
			Has to be under 62 kbyte
		Speed:
			Soft FP vs Hard fp
			48 Mhz
			less RAM. Could still be fine.

	Check viability of using NRF81 chip (M0) - NO
		No DAC or I2S, not enough pins

	Check viability of using NRF82 chip (M4F) $3.95 at q1000 - YES
		Has I2S and DAC, has plenty of PWM (12) and pins
	Check BOM breakdown, see where we can reduce cost
		Cheaper BLE crystal
		Cheaper USB conn - 10118192-0001LF could work

BLE
	How to program BLE
		Has SWD, can use my J-Link thing
			Set to nRF51822_xx??
				 Flash RAM
				AA 256 16
				AB 128 16
				AC 256 32
		Can also run wires from the Redbear programmer board to SWDIO/SWCLK? (test - may need other pins connected as well)

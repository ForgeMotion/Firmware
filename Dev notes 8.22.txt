Dev notes 8.22

PCB
	Footprint for digipot is way off
	Don't need test pads for SPI
	make a nicer jtag pin pattern

Audio
	Filenames are always uppercase 8.3 format
	Looks like files will can be raw, or mp3 if mp3 library is added
	Need to look at memory consumption once its running and alloc only what's needed

	Ok, we're going to use the SerialFlash library, which has an audio to DAQ example (MP3Player.ino)
	It also has a python script to send data to the teensy, and a sketch to pass the data onto the flash chip (CopyFromSerial.ino)

Tap Detection
	It looks like we got access to the library from Invensense (MotionDriver 6.1) which has commands for all of the features, and there's Arm 32 bit example code. 
	I can implement this library by defining the appropriate I2C commands.. This should all be tested on a normal teensy and mpu-605 breakout.
	Good news: you can detect taps in only particular directions (e.g. Z backwards), you can set it to only trigger when 2 (or 1 or 3 or 4) taps are detected, and you can adjust the threshold and timing.
	Adding the library to the code folder.

	Definitely should be using the latest MPU-6050 library from the "develop" (testing) branch. It has a lot of fixes. Going to merge in my Euler angle and other fixes locally. 

	Also, the MPU calibration code that someone wrote a while ago, someone figured out the bugs and posted about it. Saving a current version and then I'll build in their changes and test it.

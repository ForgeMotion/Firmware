Dev notes 8.22

PCB
	Footprint for digipot is way off
	Don't need test pads for SPI
	make a nicer jtag pin pattern

Audio
	Filenames are always uppercase 8.3 format
	Looks like files will can be raw, or mp3 if mp3 library is added
	Need to look at memory consumption once its running and alloc only what's needed

	Ok, we're going to use the SerialFlash library, which has an audio to DAQ example (MP3Player.ino)
	It also has a python script to send data to the teensy, and a sketch to pass the data onto the flash chip (CopyFromSerial.ino)

	Got successful erase and read/write from flash memory - for yellow PCB, had to add following to both erase and r/w examples:
		SPI.setMOSI(11);
		SPI.setMISO(12);

Tap Detection
	See Tap detection dev notes 9.8.c

Merging MPU6050 library changes:
	The MPU calibration code that someone wrote a while ago, someone figured out the bugs and posted about it. Saving a current version and then I'll build in their changes and test it. (done)

	Latest lib uses MPU6050_DMP_FIFO_RATE_DIVISOR to set dmp read frequency (f = 200Hz/(1+MPU6050_DMP_FIFO_RATE_DIVISOR)), I used MPU6050_DMP_FIFO_RATE_DIVISOR = 0x03 in last version, so that will need to be in the new main code
	Added in the proper euler equation, using an ifdef for a quick reversion
	Added in the getNorm function (unsure if it was ever used)


Full System factory calibration
	The hardware test sketch needs to be updated
	it should get calibration values for the IMU and save them to eeprom
	main code should pull them from eeprom on boot

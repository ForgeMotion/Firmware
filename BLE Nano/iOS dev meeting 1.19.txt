iOS dev meeting 1.19

From Julian's UI:
	(needs to be redesigned)
	connect button says "no device"
	click -> popup to scanning -> select device
	select -> button is green and says "ok"

	how to know what device is yours
	what if only one device
		do not auto connect, in case someone else's vest or another ble nano device
		force to pick from list.

pressing connection button disconnects (done!)
disconnect when closing app




other notes:
	when pressing load, if disconnected, doScan() to try to connect

setting the name inside the firmware:
	ios will pull both the CFG_GAP_LOCAL_NAME and the SHORTENED_LOCAL_NAME, but the CFG_GAP_LOCAL_NAME takes priority
	CFG_GAP_LOCAL_NAME is a #def to a string, which is really annoying, since you can't variably change a #def. 
	need to auto generate keys and generate the gap name
	ergo, change library to use gap name as a property? or auto generate config files?

	the example android app uses the shortened_local_name though!n

	Went through all of the zendesk questions
		This guy had the same issue on one BLE nano, they recommended replacing it. my issue is with both nanos and the programmer

		Also the same issue, though could just be the fixed bug on mac os x. Anyway, seems like the bug is hardware independent - persists after replacement

		Possibly the same issue (though he gets fail.txt, SWD ERROR), solution may have been better soldering
